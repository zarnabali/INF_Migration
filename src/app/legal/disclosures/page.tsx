          This website contains highlights of the plans developed by CHUBB, which include
          travel insurance coverages underwritten by the CHUBB International Principal
          Office located in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey. Insurance coverages in these
          plans are subject to terms, limitations and exclusions including an exclusion for
          pre-existing medical conditions. In most states, your travel retailer is not a
          licensed insurance producer/agent, and is not qualified or authorized to answer
          technical questions about the terms, benefits, exclusions and conditions of the
          insurance offered or to evaluate the adequacy of your existing insurance coverage.
          Your travel retailer may be compensated for the purchase of a plan and may provide
          general information about the plans offered, including a description of the
          coverage and price. The purchase of travel insurance is not required in order to
          purchase any other product or service from your travel retailer.
        </p>

        <p className="my-4">
          The cost of your plan is for the entire plan, which consists of both insurance and
          non-insurance components. Individuals looking to obtain additional information
          regarding the features and pricing of each travel plan component, please contact
          Chubb Insurance Solutions Agency:
